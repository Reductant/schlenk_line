This was, in a lot of ways, a pretty sucky year (you might have heard something about it in the news). And so when I came across William Gibson's Pattern Recognition and thoroughly enjoyed it, I did myself a favour: I relaxed my usual rule of not reading multiple novels by the same author in one year and bought the rest of the Blue Ant trilogy. The loose follow-up to Pattern Recognition was the equally excellent Spook Country. The third instalment, Zero History, was the weakest of the three. While I'm sure its story was the least engaging, I wonder how much it mattered that this one I read rather than listened to. There's something about the cadence of Gibson's writing that lends itself to being spoken out loud, I think.

I'd read Foundation when I was quite young, and on re-reading it I was surprised by how boring it was. Death's End, too, was exhausting, and I didn't make much of Kraken. Schlenk's a talentless hack whose book was riddled with typos; plus he has a silly name. The Casual Vacancy was excellent: flawlessly observed, brutal in its emotional realism. I couldn't get into My Family and Other Animals: it dwelt too much on themes of love of nature and quiet appreciation of the world's beauty; it was unhealthily wholesome.

Robert Harris's book was interesting. It was gripping, as one would expect from an unrivalled master of slow-burning suspense; and yet the overall feeling was of an accomplished writer of thrillers making a foray into science fiction without having done his genre homework. As a thriller, excellent, but as science fiction, it was let down by missteps in its world-building that a real sci-fi writer would not have made.

Overall though, the year's best novel was Children of Time, a riveting clash of civilisations story in a fascinating remote future. This was world-building done right, featuring a society as convincing as it was alien, and a final conflict that had me rooting for both sides.

In comics, Naoki Urasawa's note-perfect storytelling continues to impress in 20th Century Boys. Scott McCloud's books made me want to pick up a pen and start drawing. Cigarette Girl was sweetly understated. The Imitation Game, a retelling of Alan Turing's life, was rather flat, with dialogue full of Americanisms that made no historical sense.

Some excellent non-fiction this year. For the top spot I'm torn between Philip Pullman's essay collection on writing, the excellent Daemon Voices; and Chris Daw's book on criminal justice reform, which was harrowing in places and completely convincing. The best history was Making Sense of the Troubles. Gene Kranz's autobiography was superb, its descriptions of putting people on the Moon utterly thrilling. Dorsey Armstrong's lecture series on the Black Death was excellent, and worryingly topical. Invisible Women was magnificent, necessary, enraging. Identity was fascinating and insightful; The Cloudspotter's Guide whimisical and gentle.

If you read just one hard-core textbook on statistical theory next year (well, you might...), I can't recommend enough McEllreath's magnificent Statistical Rethinking. The project is an exciting one: a complete statistics course, including even the very basics, taught from an exclusively Bayesian perspective. By the end of it, the Bayesian approach is so intuitive that it feels surprising that stats could be taught any other way.
